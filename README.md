PEDESTRAINS PROTECTION AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SAFETY SYSTEM

PROBLEM - ROAD ACCIDENTS

PROBLEM STATEMENT

At least 10 people die every day due road accident many of these being pedestrians
that are as result of invisible road signs which is one of the contributors to these
staggering statistics. Due to the large number of human lives lost as a result of road of
accidents road safety has become a major great concern to almost every person today
in uganda.

SOLUTION 
PEDESTRAINS PROTECTION AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SAFETY SYSTEM

HOW IT WORKS
install intelligent robot cops along Kampala major roads to protect and enable pedestrians to cross the city roads safely. 

These intelligent robots are equipped with cameras that can record everything happening along the roads. Even at night, the robots operate and collect data, and they are enabled by infra-red radiation. Furthermore, the robots are designed to correlate the functions of human traffic officers and traffic lights.
Help in controlling traffic. These robots will be pole like structures which will open and close like road blocks to prevent cars from passing when lights are off or on. Hence allowing people to pass.

These robots have high-performance cameras which are capable of monitoring the speed limits of passing vehicles
These robots connect directly to the car VIA RFID SENSORS. when the car comes in close range using RFID technology, It will read the car id and gain access to the routes the car used while in transit. This data helps the police to track which routes the car used and the areas it passed through.
vehicles may install RFID devices that can Hold car data coupled with RFID sensors that transmit data to these robots on each check point.
The robots main purpose it to help pedestrians cross the road safely and also and control traffic jam by preventing cars from crossing the road when lights are on which could cause road accidents.

This system will also cab boda boda cyclists who pass through the road on traffic lights when on where by they have huge risks of being into an accident if knocked down by a speeding car in the moving lane.
The data collected by the robots is sent to a centralized system that is used by the police to track vehicles during a crime committed.
This system works best where traffic lights are placed hence work together with the traffic lights.
